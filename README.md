# Hyperparameter_Tuning_SVM_Classification
This project uses cardiotocography dataset and Seoul rented bikes dataset. Main aim of this project is to find the best parameters of the model using hyper parameter tuning and evaluating the generalizability of the model by doing k-fold cross validation.

Additional Models inluded [for both the datasets]:
1) Decision Tree - Hyperparameter tuning
2) Boosted Decision Tree using Adaboost

Please go through the documentation for details report on the models
